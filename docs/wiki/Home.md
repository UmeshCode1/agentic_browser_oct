# Welcome to the Agentic Browser Wiki

The **Agentic Browser** is an autonomous web navigation and information extraction system. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason through browser-based tasks, mimicking human interaction to achieve complex goals.

## 🚀 Key Objectives

- **Autonomy:** Perform tasks without constant human intervention.
- **Reasoning:** Use a Plan-Act-Observe-Decide loop to handle dynamic web environments.
- **Transparency:** Real-time visibility into the agent's thought process and actions.

## 📘 Quick Navigation
